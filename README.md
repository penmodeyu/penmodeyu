In the past couple of years there has been an online explosion in the number of personal Webcam sites. More people are choosing to live in front of a camera, hooked up to the Internet via a high-speed connection.

### Project

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```c++
template <class FwdIt, class Compare = std::less<typename FwdIt::value_type>>
void quickSort(FwdIt first, FwdIt last, Compare cmp = Compare{}) {
  auto const N = std::distance(first, last);
  if (N <= 1)
    return;
  auto const pivot = std::next(first, N / 2);
  std::nth_element(first, pivot, last, cmp);
  quickSort(first, pivot, cmp);
  quickSort(pivot, last, cmp);
}
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
